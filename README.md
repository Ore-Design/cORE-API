## Overview

The **cORE API** is a public repository that contains necessary classes for access to and authentication against the **cORE** servers.

## Getting Started

To get started with the cORE API, follow these steps:

1. **Add Repository to your Project:**
   JitPack is used to host the public repository. Make sure that you have the repository source listed in your package manager.

   Gradle:
   ```bash
   repositories {
      mavenCentral()
      maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
   }
   ```
   Maven:
   ```bash
   <repositories>
		<repository>
		    <id>jitpack.io</id>
		    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
		</repository>
	</repositories>
   ```

   Then add the API to your project dependancies.

   Gradle:
   ```bash
   dependencies
   {
      implementation 'com.github.Ore-Design:cORE-API:1.0.0'
   }
   ```
   Maven:
   ```bash
   <dependency>
	    <groupId>com.github.Ore-Design</groupId>
	    <artifactId>cORE-API</artifactId>
	    <version>1.0.0</version>
	</dependency>
   ```
